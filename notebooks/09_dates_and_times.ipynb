    "- Dates and times are seemingly simple, yet apparently, frustratingly complex. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY&t=612s) about time zones. There are three simple questions that embody this complexity:\n",
    "    1. How many days in a year? 365!…unless it is a leap year. Leap years happen every 4 years!…unless the year can be evenly divided by 100, then it’s not!…unless it is also divisible by 400, then it is!\n",
    "    1. How many hours in a day? 24!…unless a given location celebrates daylight saving time. Then it’s 23 and 25 once a year!\n",
    "    1. How many seconds in a minute? 60!…unless there is leap second, then it’s 61!\n",
    "- We'll first cover a whole bunch of interesting background info and cover international date and time standards.  Python often does not return date and time data in these standard formats and this is something to keep in mind.\n",
    "- We'll then cover the following modules:\n",
    "    1. `time`\n",
    "    1. `datetime`\n",
    "    1. `zoneinfo`\n",
    "- We won't cover the following modules, but know that they are also used with date and time data\n",

    "### Time Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local/Civil Time**--what we mean when we ask \"What time is it?\".  It is UTC +- hours offset because of the time zone.  Time zones are drawn so that when the clock strikes 12 anywhere in the world, the sun is at roughly the highest point above the horizon (high noon) for that day.  We say roughly because this depends on the longitude within the time zone.  Being within the same time zone is useful for commercial and social communication.  Local time is also adjusted if a region adheres to a daylight saving time.  Daylight saving time allows higher latitude regions to adjust which clock times experience more sunlight during different seasons. In the USA we spring forward and skip the hour from 2 AM - 3 AM. We fall back and repeat the hour from 1 AM to 2 AM.\n",
    "- **Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**--basis of local time.  Primary time standard worldwide.  Successor to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  UTC uses International Atomic Time and adds leap seconds as needed to keep up with Solar time.  Because the need for leap seconds can not be accurately calculated in advance, we do not actually know the interval of seconds there are to a date in the future! Mind blown.\n",
    "- **Solar Time**--based upon the concept of a solar day.  It takes Earth ~24 hours to rotate on its axis so that the Sun appears in the same spot in the sky.  The **apparent solar day** changes in length by +- 30 seconds throughout the year (1 rotation around Sun) because the orbit of the Earth around the Sun in not a perfect circle.  For this reason the **mean solar day** is used, which is an average of apparent solar day lengths.  For accuracy reasons, in today's age, solar time is measured by the position of the Earth relative to radio emissions from objects in other galaxies.\n",
    "- **International Atomic Time (TAI)**--time keeping system based on atomic clocks.  Atomic clocks are the most accurate time keeping mechanism and measure the electromagnetic emissions of atoms when they change energy levels.  TAI does NOT use leap seconds.  Currently, TAI - UTC = 37 seconds.  The 37 seconds result from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 27 leap seconds in UTC since 1972.\n",
    "- **GPS Time**--GPS satellites have onboard atomic clocks that use GPS Time. GPS time was set in 1980 to the then current UTC time.  Does NOT uses leap seconds.  Because both TAI and GPS do not use leap seconds, there will always be a 19 second offset.  TAI - UTC = 19 seconds.\n",
    "- **Leap seconds**--used to accommodate differences between precise time (as measured by atomic clocks) and imprecise solar time (which is affected by the gradual slowdown of Earth's rotation).\n",
    "- **Epoch**--point where time starts\n",
    "- **Unix time/POSIX time**--time is measured as the number of seconds since 12 AM (midnight) January 1, 1970, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  Commonly used in computer programming.  It is said that Unix time does not use leap seconds.  This is true, but misleading!  Unix time never *adds* a leap seconds like UTC does.  However Unix time still syncs up with UTC.  When UTC adds a second to a day, Unix time *repeats* 23:59:59 twice.  Repeating a second means two seconds on the Unix clock map to the same time!  This can cause errors in computer programs.\n",
    "- The most obvious workaround is to use TAI for operational purposes and use UTC for displaying the time of day to humans.  UTC can easily be derived from TAI using a leap second table. Sometimes, leap smears are used to solve this problem.  This involves spreading the repetition of a second out over a 24 hour period. Lastly, there are also proposals to eliminate leap seconds from UTC so that is very (very) slowly drifts away from solar time."
