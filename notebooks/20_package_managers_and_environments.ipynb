    "## Package Managers\n",
    "- Many of Python's advanced features are found in modules/packages/libraries\n",
    "- If a module/package/library does not come pre-installed we need to download and install it using a package manager\n",
    "- **Package Manager**--program that downloads, installs, and organizes packages\n",
    "- There are two main Python package managers:\n",
    "    1. **pip**--stands for Pip Installs Packages (recursive acronym).  Python's officially endorsed open source package manager.   Both a program and a Python module.   Written in Python.  Only installs Python packages.  Used to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or GitHub. PyPI is the largest repository of Python packages, with over 150,000.\n",
    "    1. **conda**--open source package manager program. Mostly used to install Python modules/packages/libraries, but can be used to install packages for other languages like R, C, C++, etc.  Installs packages from Anaconda repository, which has 1,500 of the most popular packages or the conda-forge, which is like the open source version of the Anaconda repository. conda is used by the Miniconda, Miniforge, and Anaconda Python distribution.  conda also manages \"environments\" to prevent non-compatible versions of packages and programs from causing errors."

    "- **Environment**--combination of Python interpreter program (python.exe) and installed packages that we are using\n",
    "- **Global Environment**--by default, when python.exe is installed, it runs in the global environment.  This is not specific to any project or folder.  If we run the Python interpreter by typing `python` into the Command Prompt, it opens the interpreter in the global environment. If we install a package with pip, it is installed in the global environment.\n",
    "- Working in the global environment is easy.  However, over time it may become cluttered by all the packages we have installed.  Some packages may not be compatible with each other or we may have different versions of the same package.  We may also want to use a different version of the Python interpreter.  E.g. Python 3.7 or 3.9.  For complicated Python projects/scripts, it becomes hard to ensure that a Python script will work if we are testing it in the global environment.  Which Python interpreter version and combination of packages is needed to run the script without bugs?\n",
    "- **Virtual Environment**--isolated subfolder (environment) that contains a specified version of the Python interpreter.  We can install the packages we need for a particular project into this environment.  Prevents package compatibility issues.  Good for script testing.  The terms environment and virtual environment are used interchangeably.\n",
    "- There are multiple ways to create a virtual environment in Python.  It gets confusing.\n",
    "    1. conda--manages both packages and environments.  Used by Anaconda, Miniconda, and MiniForge.  Popular in the data science community.\n",
    "    1. pip + `venv`--now included with the Python Standard Library.  If using pip, most recommended.\n",
    "    1. pip +`pipenv`--also recommended, but complex\n",
    "    1. pip + `poetry`--also recommend, but complex\n",
    "    1. pip + `virtualenv`--older. Not recommended.\n",
    "    1. pip + `pyenv`--used for installing different Python versions.  Not recommended."
