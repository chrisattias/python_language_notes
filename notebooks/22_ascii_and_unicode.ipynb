    "- **ASCII**--American Standard Code for Information Interchange.  It was created by the American National Standards Institute in the early 1960s. Uppercase and lowercase English letters, characters 0-9, punctuation/symbols, and some basic computer commands are mapped to numbers.  All ASCII is, is the mapping of characters to numbers.  These numbers are commonly written in base 2, 10, or 16 (hexadecimal).\n",
    "- Standard ASCII is 7 bits long and can map $2^7 = 128$ unique characters.  \n",

Take the 5 digits to the right, use them as binary, convert to decimal, and we get 26.  \"Z\" is the 26th letter of the alphabet.\n",

    "- Notice how the characters 0-9 on the keyboard are mapped to the decimal numbers 48 to 57.  This was chosen because we can write 48-57 as binary (base 2) numbers, then take the right 4 digits.  These right 4 digits are themselves the binary (base 2) numbers for the the decimal numbers 0-9.  MIND BLOWN!!!"

    "- However, computers ultimately store 1s and 0s and so we use the binary (base 2) number for each character when we store them on the computer or when we send data across the internet\n",
    "- Depending on the character, the binary number could take up anywhere from 1-4 bytes of space.  And how do we concatenate binary numbers so that we know which 1s and which 0s correspond to which characters?  This is where UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 come in.\n",

    "\n",
    "**UTF-16**\n",
    "\n",
    "- UTF-16 stands for Unicode Transformation Format 16.  UTF-16 is a variable-width code that uses one or two 16 bit chunks (code units) to encode each character. Microsoft Windows, Java, and Javascript use UTF-16.  Windows is moving away from it to UTF-8 in the future.\n",

    "- The reason for this variable width encoding comes back to efficient use of computer memory.  If we map/encode a single character to its binary (base 2) number and always store this using 32 bits for every character, we end up with lots of 0s that are just filler.  Ex. \"A\" would be 00000000 00000000 00000000 010000001.\n",
    "- For a character that uses 1 byte, the standard 7 bit ASCII codes are used. UTF-8 is simply that 7 bit binary number with a 0 in front. The UTF-8 code for \"A\" is 01000001.  So standard ASCII is valid UTF-8!\n",
    "- For characters stored using 2-4 bytes, UTF-8 uses certain bits to indicate how many bytes the character is.  In the following code the `x`s are the character's binary (base 2) number, while 1s and 0s are the prefixes that indicate how many bytes there are.  A human can look at the 1s and can think the following.  Two 1s means two bytes.  Three 1s means three bytes.  Four 1s means four bytes.\n",
