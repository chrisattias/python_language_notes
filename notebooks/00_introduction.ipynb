    "## Learning Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [PY4E](https://www.py4e.com/)--intro course by Professor Chuck at the University of Michigan.  Great for those with zero computer science or programming experience.  Has video lectures, associated Powerpoints, and reference docs that parallel lecture.  Once we login through a Google account we have access to the full course (including script autograder, quizzes, and discussions) and there is no need to pay for a course on Coursera.  The only additional things on Coursera are some extra fun interviews with various CS people.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [W3shools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)--quickly covers all the major parts of Python and popular Python libraries in a very structured and organized way.  Great for review of topics already learned or for someone coming in with computer science experience already.   Allows one to practice examples of code on their website.  W3 Schools has information on many other languages as well, from Java to SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Second Edition](https://automatetheboringstuff.com)--book and online course by Al Sweigart.  Focuses on automation of repetitive tasks. Book can be read on website for free. Course not free.  Great for someone coming in with a little computer science already.  It does cover the Python basics, but moves a bit fast for complete beginners.  Clear and concise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/)--Al Sweigart has written a number of other Python books including *Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python*.  It contains best practices for writing more Pythonic code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Official Python 3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)--tutorial (not great for beginners), glossary, Python Standard Library (functions, data types, methods, modules, libraries, etc), Python Language Reference (syntax and \"core semantics\"), FAQ, etc.   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)--style guidelines for writing clear and shareable code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python library websites--many third-party Python libraries provide documentation that is built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and hosted by [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).  Others package authors may include documentation on GitHub, PyPI, or a separate library website.  For example:\n",
    "    1. [Requests Documentation](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)--online documentation for Python Requests library hosted by Read the Docs\n",

    "- The term \"Python\" is used to mean 2 things:\n",
    "    1. Python programming language. Similar to spoken languages like English.  We are learning Python words in order to build our vocabulary/lexicon.  We are also learning how to order these words to create meaningful sentences.  This is known as syntax.  When combined, we are able to write code sentences like `print(1 + 2)`.\n",
    "    1. Python interpreter.  This is the software program we download and install. E.g. \"python.exe\" on Windows.  The Python interpreter runs our user created code.  If our code sentence was `print(1 + 2)`, we could tell the Python interpreter to run our code, it would coordinate with our computer to crunch the numbers, and then display `3` on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we said, \"I'm learning Python\", we mean we are learning the programming language.  If we said, \"\"Python ran our code\", we mean the interpreter.  If we said, \"We're using Python version 3.10.0\", we mean both the language and interpreter because they evolve together.  So in the end this distinction is not that important and we'll often use the term \"Python\" to mean both!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is named after *Monty Python's Flying Circus*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python was designed to be:\n",
    "    - High level.  Reads more like English than the 1s and 0s of machine code.\n",
    "    - Interpreted.  Do not have to compile an entire Python script to machine code before running.\n",
    "    - Garbage collected.  Do not have to manually declare where in computer memory values are stored.\n",
    "    - Dynamically typed.  Do not have to manually declare data type whenever values are stored.\n",
    "    - Object oriented.  Language emphasizes nouns (objects) instead of verbs (functions).\n",
