    "### Background\n",
    "- We'll first cover some background technology terminology\n",
    "- **Spam mail**--originates from a Monty Python skit where there is way too much spam served for breakfast\n",
    "- **Email Client/Message User Agent/Mail User Agent (MUA)**--program used to access a user's email\n",
    "     - Desktop email clients: MS Outlook, Apple Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, etc.  Desktop client must be installed and configured.  They must be connected to the internet to send and receive email.  However, because they store copies of email locally, a user can access emails when not connected to the internet.\n",
    "    - Web browser email clients: Gmail, iCloud, Yahoo!, Outlook.com (Live Mail, Hotmail), Mail.com, Proton Mail, AOL Mail, etc.  Can access email anywhere, but must always be connected to the internet.\n",
    "- **SMTP**--Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Protocol for *sending* emails.  Dictates how message is formatted, encrypted, and relayed between mail servers.\n",
    "    - Port 25 for non-encrypted emails\n",
    "    - Port 465/587 for encrypted emails\n",
    "- **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)/Mail Server/SMTP Server**--middle man computers that hand off emails as they make their way across (routed across) the internet.  Uses SMTP.  Different email providers have different mail servers:\n",
    "    - smtp.gmail.com\n",
    "    - smtp-mail.outllook.com\n",
    "    - smtp.mail.yahoo.com\n",
    "    - smtp.att.net\n",
    "    - smtp.comcast.net\n",
    "    - smtp.verizon.net\n",
    "- **IMAP**--Internet Message Access Protocol.  Protocol for *receiving* emails.  With IMAP emails are stored on a remote IMAP server and are not stored by the email client on local devices.  Because emails are stored on a remote server, its easy for multiple devices to access the emails.  \n",
    "    - Port 143 for non-encrypted emails\n",
    "    - Port 993 for encrypted emails\n",
    "- **IMAP Servers**--different email providers use different IMAP servers.  Popular ones are:\n",
    "    - imap.gmail.com\n",
    "    - imap-mail.outlook.com\n",
    "    - imap.mail.yahoo.com\n",
    "    - imap.mail.att.net\n",
    "    - imap.comcast.net\n",
    "    - incoming.verizon.net\n",
    "- **POP3**--Post Office Protocol.  In a nutshell, an older, simpler version of IMAP.  Mostly replaced by IMAP as POP does not work well when users access the same email account from multiple devices.\n",
    "    - Port 110 for non-encrypted emails\n",
    "    - Port 996 for encrypted emails\n",
    "- **MIME**--Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions.  Internet standard  that extends the format of email messages to support non-ASCII text characters and attachments of audio, images, and video.  Also allows us to combine plaintext with HTML in emails.\n",
    "- **SSL** and **TLS**--see the background reading in the *HTTP Requests* section for more info.  When users use a web browser email client they often use HTTPS.  HTTPS is secure because it uses TLS for encryption.  TLS has replaced SSL, but the term SSL is still often used (even if we are talking about TLS).\n",
    "- Steps to send and receive an email are as follows:\n",
    "    1. Sender types up email in email client.  Email uses MIME format.  Clicks send.\n",
    "    1. Email routed to multiple MTA servers using SMTP as it makes its way across the internet.\n",
    "    1. Email sent to IMAP server where it is stored\n",
    "    1. Recipient email client accesses email using IMAP\n",
    "- **Transactional Email**--autogenerated and sent email that a user receives as part of a transaction.  It could be confirmation email for an account creation, payment receipt, password resets, etc.\n",
    "- **Transactional Email Services**--paid for service that will send transactional emails for us.  They also track delivery statistics like delivery rate.  These services usually have free plans so one can test out the service.  There are many transactional service companies including:\n",
    "    - Sengrid\n",
    "    - Sendinblue\n",
    "    - Mailgun\n",
    "    - Mailjet\n",
    "    - Amazon SES\n",
    "- Many of these, like Sengrid, have their own Python modules"

    "- When using user created scripts to send and receive emails:\n",
    "    1. Create a new email account.  This prevents headaches that may result from accidentally showing username and password information or accidentally sending too many emails that get flagged as spam.  It will also prevent our personal inbox from filling up with script related emails.  If we are creating a Gmail account we also need to enable \"Less secure app access\" for the account.\n",
    "    2. Do NOT put user name and password information in source code in case others view or use code.  If needed, have users input username and password information.  If it is only stored in a variable the Python garbage collector will delete it from memory when the function or script ends.\n",
