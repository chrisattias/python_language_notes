    "- Big O algorithm analysis is a compliment to profiling that can help programmers write faster programs\n",
    "- **Big O Algorithm Analysis**--\"how code slows as data grows\".  Theory that describes how code structure runtime increases as the amount of data processed increases.  It is called big O because notation uses an \"O\" to describe different \"orders\".  \n",
    "- **Orders**--levels of speed\n",
    "- Orders are differentiated using names and/or function grammar. In the function the \"O\" stands for order.  The \"n\" represents the size of the data input.  The function output is unitless, but can be thought of as the runtime or the number of steps (operations) that must be taken for each algorithm to complete.\n",
    "    - E.g. Name of order is linear time.  Function notation is O(n). Function can be read, \"big O of n\"\n",
    "- We'll write the orders from fastest to slowest.  These are the most commonly used orders, but there are others.\n",
    "- For each order we'll provide:\n",
    "    1. A mathematical example.  **Note that in programming it is often assumed that logarithms use a base of 2.**  We'll use \"8\" as the data size in examples as it provides easy math with base 2 logarithms.  \n",
    "    1. The general programming idea\n",
    "    1. A bookshelf metaphor where the number of books represents the data size    \n",
    "1. **O(1), Constant Time**\n",
    "    - Math example: 1\n",
    "    - General idea: runtime is not affected by data size.  Runtime is constant. Sometimes written as O(c), where \"c\" stands for constant.\n",
    "    - Bookshelf example: code checks if any books on bookshelf (0 books vs 1 or more books) and then stops.  This is 1 step.\n",
    "1. **O(log n), Logarithmic Time**\n",
    "    - Math example: log(8) = 3\n",
    "    - General idea: logarithmic relationship is the inverse of exponential.  Seen in the binary search algorithm.\n",
    "    - Bookshelf example: code searches for a specified book in alphabetized bookshelf.  Starts checking in the middle of the shelf.  If that is the book, it's done.  This is step 1.  Otherwise, determines if book starts with a higher or lower letter.  Checks the middle of that half.  If that is the book, it's done.  This is step 2. Etc...   This is a binary search algorithm.  Number of splits = number of steps.  If 8 books, 3 splits = 3 steps.\n",
    "1. **O(n), Linear Time**\n",
    "    - Math example:. 8 = 8\n",
    "    - General idea: code loops over the data once.  Seen in for loops and \"simple search\".  A simple search is where we try every possible item to identify correct one.\n",

    "1. **O(n log n), N-Log-N Time**\n",
    "    - Math example: 8 log(8) = 24\n",
    "    - General idea: seen in fast sorting algorithms like quicksort, merge sort, heapsort, and Timsort\n",
    "    - Bookshelf example: code sorts the books into alphabetical order.  Follows steps for binary search algorithm to place a single book on the bookshelf in the correct place.  Repeat steps for each book. If 8 books, 3 splits = 3 steps.  Repeat for each of 8 books.  3 x 8 = 24 steps.\n",
    "1. **O(n^2), Quadratic Time**\n",
    "    - Math example: 8^2 = 64\n",
    "    - General idea: n raised to a small integer.  It may be quadratic (n^2), cubic (n^3), etc.  For this reason it is also called polynomial time.  Seen in nested for loops. Seen in slow sorting algorithms like selection sort, bubble sort, and insertion sort. \n",
    "    - Bookshelf example: code checks for duplicate books on an unsorted bookshelf.  If 8 books, starts with the first book and compares it with the other 7 books to see if they are the same.  This takes 7, ~8 steps.  Repeat for each of 8 books. 8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8 =  8 x 8 = 64 steps.\n",

    "    - General idea: find quantity of unique combinations.  Each combination does not have to use all elements.  Must not use any individual element more than once (selection without replacement).  Permutations of bits (think ASCII) also follows exponential time, but this is a bit different than the example here.\n",
    "    - Bookshelf example: code finds combinations of books.  If 3 books in total, named A, B, and C we could have no books, A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, and ABC.  2^3 = 8.  If 8 books in total, 2^8 = 256. 256 steps.\n",
    "1. **O(n!), Factorial Time**\n",

    "    - General idea: find quantity of unique permutations.  Each permutation must use all elements.  Must not use any individual elements more than once (selection without replacement).  Permutations are combinations where element position matters.  Seen in traveling sales person.\n",
    "    - Bookshelf example: code finds permutations of books.  If 3 books in total, named A, B, and C, we could have ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, or CBA.  We can also use the idea of selection without replacement.  There are 3 book options for the first slot, two book options for the second slot, and 1 book option for the third.  3x2x1 = 6.  If 8 books in total, 8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 = 40,320 permutations.  Each permutation must be searched, so for 8 books = 40,320 steps.\n",

    "- **Worst case scenario**--largest possible number of steps an algorithm may take to complete\n",
    "- In big O analysis, if not otherwise stated, it should be assumed that an order is is referring to an algorithm's worst case.\n",
    "     - E.g. in a search algorithm we may get lucky and select the correct item on the first try or it may take until the last possible try.  Big O assumes the latter.\n",
    "- **Average case scenario**--average number of steps an algorithm takes to complete\n",
    "- There are times when we may choose to compare average cases.  Two algorithms may solve the same problem.  One may have a lower average number of steps, but also a higher number of steps in the worst case scenario.  If the latter is acceptable, then we may choose the algorithm with the lower average.\n",
    "- Steps for applying big O algorithm analysis to real-world code:\n",
    "    1. Identify n.  Often argument in function.\n",
    "    1. Count steps in code.  This is not an exact measurement, only an approximation.  Each line of code is counted as a step.  Within loops, each line of code should be multiplied by the number of iterations.\n",
    "    1. Drop lower orders.  These are not impactful when compared to highest order.\n",
    "    1. Drop coefficients of highest order.  Coefficients are only impactful when comparing algorithms of the same order.\n",
    "- Big picture ideas include:\n",
    "    1. The jump from O(n log n) to O(n^2) is the largest runtime difference and much of big O analysis revolves around recognizing algorithms with O(n^2) or higher orders and modifying them (or choosing new algorithms) so they are are O(n log n) or lower orders.\n",
    "    1. Big O analysis only matters if the size of the data is very large...and usually it is not!"

    "1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**--used for classification or regression.  There are elements/items of a sample or population.  For a new element we can predict a response variable (called a feature) using explanatory variables.  Elements are plotted on a graph.  Each axis represents an explanatory.  We then choose the closest neighboring points to base the prediction off of.  The number of neighboring points we choose is denoted $k$. The nearness is calculated using a distance formula.  If the response variable is categorical then it is said to be KNN classification as we predict the level of the category from the neighboring points.  E.g. if the majority of neighbors have a blue color then we predict our new element is also blue.  If the unknown variable is numerical then it is called KNN regression.  E.g. if the mean of the nearest neighbors is 5 grams, we predict our new element is also 5 grams.\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Programming**--optimize something given a constraint.  Break problem into subproblems.  Every dynamic programming solution involves a grid of cell values. Each cell value is a subproblem we try to optimize.  By optimizing subproblems we can find the optimal solution to entire problem.\n",
    "1. **Linear Programming**--maximize something given constraints using the simplex algorithm. Similar goals as dynamic programming, but uses linear equations instead of grids.\n",
    "1. **Trees**--there are many types of graphs (the node and vertex kind).  Trees are graphs with special properties.  E.g. binary trees can be used to store sorted data.  Binary trees are faster than arrays at insertion and deletion for sorted data.\n",
    "1. **Inverted Indices**--hash table that maps individual words to places they appear.  Often used in web search engines.\n",
    "1. **Fourier Transform**--\"Given a smoothie, the Fourier transform will tell us the ingredients in the smoothie.\" Pass a signal into a set of filters and break signal into component parts. Commonly used to filter cell phone and WiFi signals and break audio, image, and video files down into component parts for compression.\n",
    "1. **Probabilistic Algorithm**--return probabilistic answer that is not definitive.  Hash tables can be used to definitively see if a key belongs in a group (the value).  However, if groups are massive hash tables take up too much space.  E.g. could store websites URLs (keys) along with whether or not they are malicious (\"Yes\" or \"No\" groups) in a hash table, but this would take too much memory when there are trillions of websites. Instead, can use a bloom filter probabilistic algorithm to guess whether or not website URL is in the malicious group.\n",
    "1. **Parallel Algorithm**--algorithm split between different processors (cores) of a multi-core CPU\n",
    "1. **Distributed Algorithm**--parallel algorithm that is run on hundreds of cores.  MapReduce function is a common distributed algorithm that is helpful when functions input millions of data points."
