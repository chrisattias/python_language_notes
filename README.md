## Overview
- This GitHub repository contains notes on the Python programming language.  
- We explore a wide variety of topics relevant to beginner and intermediate pythonistas.  
- These notebooks are NOT meant to teach the Python programming language to a brand new coder.  
- Instead, they are intended to act as well-organized reference documents for those learning Python from other courses and sources.  
- Though the target audience of these notebooks is forgetful future me, if another person stumbles upon them and finds them helpful then all the better!
